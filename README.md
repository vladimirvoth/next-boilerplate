# Next.js Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate to kickstart a new Next.js project. The goal of this project is to make it as easy and fast as possible to get a production-ready Next.js app with all features you could think of and probably need. Also, notice that this boilerplate is just a part of an even bigger project the Next.js Boilerplate CLI [Next.js Boilerplate CLI](https://github.com/vladimirvoth/next-boilerplate-cli 'Next.js Boilerplate CLI') to generate complete new projects, pages with SCSS/SAAS files and tests, and much more, automatically.

In case you don't know what Next.js is, it's a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. Learn more about [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/ 'Next.js').
